12v-5v-reg
==========

A switched 12Volt to 5Volt regulator

Will take a nominal 12v in (designed for a lead acid) and produced a regulated 5v supply capable of supplying 2A.

The onboard LEDs show the prescenec of 12V, the switch status, and the prescence of the 5V output.  These LEDs can be disabled to minimise power usage

There is a bypass jumper to enable the output to remain active independently of the enable status.

The enable pins will turn the output on high.

This board has yet to be built and tested so should be considered in alpha status.
